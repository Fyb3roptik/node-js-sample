<P class="p17 ft4">If you do not meet the eligibility requirements of this section, then you are not authorized to use the Service. BEAST FRANCHISE may require you to provide proof that you are eligible to participate according to this section prior to receiving a prize. This includes by requesting that you fill out an affidavit of eligibility. To the extent BEAST FRANCHISE requests that you fill out such an affidavit and you fail to do so within 5 days, or BEAST FRANCHISE otherwise determines that you do not meet the eligibility requirements of this section, in addition to any rights that BEAST FRANCHISE may have in law or equity, BEAST FRANCHISE reserves the right to terminate your account and withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes associated with such account. In such a situation, BEAST FRANCHISE will pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to the other entrants in the relevant contest in a manner consistent with the prize structure of the contest, to be precisely determined by BEAST FRANCHISE in its sole discretion.</P>

You agree to (a) never to use the same Password for the Service that you use or have ever used outside of the Service; (b) keep your Username and Password confidential and not share them with anyone else; (c) immediately notify BEAST FRANCHISE of any unauthorized use of your Username and Password or account or any other breach of security; and (d) use only your own Username and Password to access the Service’s Restricted Areas.

<P class="p32 ft5">5. Game Rules</P>
<P class="p21 ft12">Game of Skill</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">BEAST FRANCHISE is a game of skill. Winners are determined by the criteria stated in each contest's rules. For each contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant professional sports information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most fantasy points. Fantasy points are accumulated through the performance of individual athletes across the MLB according to your BEAST FRANCHISE batting order.</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">Entry fees</P>
<P class="p34 ft9">Each BEAST FRANCHISE contest has an entry fee listed in US dollars. When you opt to participate in a contest, that amount in US dollars will be debited from your BEAST FRANCHISE account. Then, follow the links and instructions provided for entry. In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person submitting an entry, the entry will be deemed submitted by the person in whose Username the entry was submitted, or if possession of the Username itself is contested and in BEAST FRANCHISE’s opinion sufficiently uncertain, the name in which the email address on file was registered with the email service provider. BEAST FRANCHISE reserves the right not to award a prize to an individual it believes in its sole discretion did not submit the winning entry.</P>

<P class="p26 ft12">Prizes</P>
<P class="p7 ft4">After each contest ends, the tentative winners are announced (generally by the following day) but remain subject to final verification. The players in each contest who accumulate the most fantasy points and comply with eligibility requirements and applicable rules will win prizes as set out in the posted contest details. Prizes are added to the winning team's account balance. In the event of a tie, the prize is divided evenly between the tied players, unless otherwise specified.</P>

<P class="p19 ft9">Prize calculations are based on the results as of the time when final scoring is tabulated by BEAST FRANCHISE. Once winners are initially announced by BEAST FRANCHISE, the scoring results will not be changed in light of official adjustments made by the professional leagues, though we reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in the transmission of information to us from our stats provider or in our calculation of results. We also may make adjustments in the event of noncompliance with the Terms. BEAST FRANCHISE has no obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of any adjustment, and we reserve the right to reverse payments in the event of any adjustment.

<P class="p75 ft4">settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</P>
<P class="p26 ft12">Binding Arbitration</P>
<P class="p76 ft9">If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</P>
<P class="p77 ft9">The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4">The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, BEAST FRANCHISE will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non­frivolous, BEAST FRANCHISE will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</P>
<P class="p78 ft12">Location</P>
<P class="p79 ft4">If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents in Canada, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and BEAST FRANCHISE agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_14">


<P class="p0 ft12">Class Action Waiver</P>
<P class="p7 ft9">The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND BEAST FRANCHISE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</P>
